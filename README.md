pixelprimes
===========

Pixel Primes is a C# console application that creates an image (png) of an Ulam's Spiral.

The image dimensions will need to be square (i.e. 800x800) for the image to be created properly. There are notes on the specifics in Utility.cs.

To read more about what an Ulam's Spiral is, I recommend [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral).
